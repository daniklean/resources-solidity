## :point_up: Keen on diving into this resource? - Prerequisites - *setup before you start.*

You will need an IDE or at least a text editor with syntax coloring. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following plugins:

- [Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## :woman_technologist: :man_technologist: Daily Useful Commands

- Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
- Run scripts: `npx hardhat run <script-file-path>`
- Test contracts: `npx hardhat test`
- Local blockchain: `npx hardhat node`
- Connect to blockchain: Update the `hardhat.config.js` with the appropriate network configuration.
